                            Roosevelt was rescued from Chicago Animal Care and Control in April 2015. I saw him relaxing quietly in his cage as all the other dogs were barking and jumping to get my attention. He looked so sad.  His owner surrender card said “has issues urinating.” Once outside, Roosevelt peed for a long time and it was mostly just dribbling out. His teeth were totally ground down, probably from eating rocks or trying to escape his crate. We felt so helpless and so sad for him. Immediately we tried to find him a foster, so we could get him out and get him healthy. One Tail at a Time committed to rescue him and we were able to foster.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-on-white">
                            Unfortunately, even after a neuter, his urinating issues were still a problem. During his dental, the vet discovered that Roo had terminal bone cancer. Our hearts were shattered, but we knew what we had to do. Roo lived life to the FULLEST for the next 5 months. Hotel stays, boat rides, long walks, belly rubs, ice cream, even attending an LFL game...  And so much more. To Live Like Roo became a way of life, and we made sure we didn't lose one second of the time we had left.

While he didn't have a good start to life, his eyes told us how loved he felt at the end. We miss him so much and we will always have a place in our hearts for this boy that changed the way thousands of people approach life. He is one in a million and we are so grateful that he was ours and that we were able to share him with all of you. #LiveLikeRoo
