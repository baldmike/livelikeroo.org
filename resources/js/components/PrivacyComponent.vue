                    <h4>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h4>
                    <p class="body-text">We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.</p>

                    <h4>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h4>

                    <p class="body-text">You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us :</p>

                    <h4>Security</h4>

                    <p class="body-text">We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. We use Stripe to process your donations and purchases, which means your credit card information is NOT stored on our servers - this is the ultimate level of safety.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>

                    <p class="body-text"> This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
